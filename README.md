# Timing System


## About
This project consists in a timing system composed of three operating modes: Clock, Timer and Stopwatch. This system was developed for the MSP430F1121 hardware, which must be connected to a 16x1 LCD display, responsible for the display, and a 4x4 matrix keyboard, responsible for controlling the system. The following simulation printout shows the hardware and connections:

## How the system works
The system operates based on interrupts generated by MSP Timer A. A 1MHz crystal must be connected to the IC, and the Timer must be configured to generate one interrupt per second. Within the interrupt routine, the necessary updates must be made to the display.
When turned on, the system will be in Clock mode, at 00:00:00. The operating modes can be switched using the R (Clock), T (Timer) and C (Stopwatch) keys. The H+, H-, M+, M-, Z, D and P keys have different functions depending on which mode the system is operating.

### Clock Mode
In Clock mode, one second is added to the display each time the Timer is interrupted. The H+ and H- keys can be used to adjust the hours, while M+ and M- adjust the minutes. The Z, D and P keys have no function in this mode. The Clock value continues to be updated even with the system in other modes.

### Timer Mode
The Timer mode has an initial value of 00:10:00 and starts frozen. The H+ and H- keys are used to configure the timing hours, while M+ and M- configure the timing minutes. After the D key is pressed, the system starts to decrease the display by one second each time the Timer is interrupted. The P key can be pressed to freeze the timing at the current time. The Z key can be pressed to return the timer to the previously set value.

### Stopwatch Mode
Stopwatch mode starts frozen. After the D key is pressed, it starts to increase one second on the display each time the Timer is interrupted. The P key can be pressed to freeze the timer, while the Z key can be pressed to return the timer to 00:00:00. The H+, H-, M+ and M- keys have no function in this mode.
